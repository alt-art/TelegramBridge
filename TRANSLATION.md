# Translation

This plugin comes with translations for some languages, but if the language you want is not available, you can help by translating the plugin.

## Available languages

- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- Japanese (jp)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Russian (ru)

## How to translate

1. Fork this repository

2. Create a new file in the `src/main/resources/lang` directory with the name of the language code you want to translate to. For example, if you want to translate to French, create a file named `fr.yml`.

3. Copy the contents of the `en.yml` file to the new file you created.

4. Translate the values of the keys to the language you want.

5. Submit a pull request with the new file.

## Changing format for your own purposes

If the format of the texts does not suit your needs, you can change it. Just edit the translation files in the `TelegramBridge/lang` directory.
